        Like all buildings a garden room needs a solid foundation. We use a tried and trusted system of concrete piles and steel rods to lift your garden room off the ground. This prevents rotting and allows air to circulate under the building.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-xl text-justify">
        The size of the building dictates the number of piles we use, but a typical 5M x 3M garden room will have 19 piles
      </p>
    

      <p class="mb-2 mt-5 text-xl">
        This system keeps your garden room dry, free of damp and will ensure no movement even in the windiest of conditions the UK can throw at it.

        The roof of your garden room has to stand up to the elements. We use a
        rubber roof system that is designed to last for decades. The roof is
        insulated with 100mm PIR insulation to keep the warmth in during winter
        months and help keep you cool during the in the summer.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2 mt-5 text-xl font-semibold">
        Our roof system consists of the following layers:

        <li>EPDM Rubber roof to keep the garden room water proof</li>

    <div>
      <p class="mt-4 text-xl text-justify">
        We use aluminum bi-fold doors that are purpose made for garden rooms. They are slightly shorter in height than a traditional patio door, this enables us to achieve the maximum possible height of garden room while staying within permitted development rules of a 2.5m building height.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2 mt-5 text-xl text-justify">
        We use a steel section above the doors to prevent door sagging and ensure that your doors move as freely in 20 years as they do on the day they are installed.

    <div>
      <p class="mt-4 text-xl text-justify">
        Under permitted development rules you can build a garden room up to 2.5m in height without planning permission. This is calculated as the height from the highest point immediately adjacent to the garden room to the highest point of the garden room, and comes into force if the garden room is within 2 meters of a boundary fence.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2 mt-5 text-xl text-justify">
        Our foundation rod system not only allows us to get millimeter perfect levels, but it also allows us to build the maximum height garden room while staying within permitted development rules. 
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2 mt-5 text-xl text-justify">
        A lot of prefabricated garden rooms are 2.4m in height to ensure they come under the permitted development rules, this 10cm's makes a big difference and is one of the many reasons a custom built garden room excels over cheaper alternatives.
